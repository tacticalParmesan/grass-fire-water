# Grass Water Fire

# Introduction
Welcome, to the world of...Rock, Paper and Scissors?
Well, not exactly.

Hi! My name is Edoardo, but here I'm called tacticalParmesan. I'm follwing the Odin Project, the best resources collection to learn web development by doing. This repository and its contents are the results of some days of work to complete the "Rock Paper Scissors" capstone project.

More on that on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

## The Project
The project itself was relatively simple (check it out yourself [Here!](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors)), since it asked for:

1. The simple rock-paper-scissors logic implemented via Javascript;
2. A UI that displays both user and computer choices and how the game played out.

Since coding it's absolutely a fantastic activity to get better at problem solving and making creative ideas alive, I wanted to do something different, while being faithful to the essence of the project: a rock paper scissors game but played and styled like the most famous rock paper scissors implementation ever (well, after rock paper scissors itself!), an extremely simple Pokemon Game!

## Features

"Grass Water Fire" is just a Rock Paper Scissors game but the final implementation has some nice features to make it a fun (and nostalgic) experience:

1. Hands are Pokemons: the traditional rock, paper and scissors have been changed to the icon trio of Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle.
2. Game work the same but the types of the chosen pokemon determines the winner: no suprises here, grass beats water, water beats fire and fire beats grass! This very same logic is the idea behind the choice of these three types for the starter pokemons for every adventure.
3. The game results are rendered in two enclosed area that mock a little a gameboy screen, to add something to the nostalgia element, the sprites are from Pokemon Gold, the font is a pixelated one and and text is displayed one character at the time.
4. There is a theme selection option: click on the typing icons in the title and the palette will switch to a different one. There are of course three palettes: Venusaur, Blastoise, Charizard.
